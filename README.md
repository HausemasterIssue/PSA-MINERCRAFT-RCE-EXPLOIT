# Affects MC version 1.8 - 1.18

# If you have been affected
change all of your passwords, and consider wiping your pc if you want to make certian it is gone. I cannot provide a list of things that could be grabbed, as it HAS THE POWER TO RUN ANYTHING THE PERPITRATOR WANTS. Think of this as if ran a ratted client, exept you have NO IDEA what was run on your computer.

# How to perotect yourself
Thankfully, there is a simple way to fix this vunerability. adding the flag:
```
-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
```
to your minecraft launcher will pervent remote code execution.

# Affects any MC client using java 8

# How it works
An exploit in apache log4j (used in minecraft) allows RCE. I wont get too into detail here but you can find more info on the web.

# If you have been affected
change all of your passwords, and consider wiping your pc if you want to make certian it is gone. I cannot provide a list of things that could be grabbed, as it HAS THE POWER TO RUN ANYTHING THE PERPITRATOR WANTS. Think of this as if ran a ratted client, exept you have NO IDEA what was run on your computer.

# How to perotect yourself
Thankfully, there is a simple way to fix this vunerability. adding the flag:
```
-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
```
to your minecraft launcher will pervent remote code execution.

DO NOT join a MC server without this using fix. Ask admins of servers, minecraft devs, devs of plugins, and client devs to implement thier own fixed to this exploit. I would recommend always leaving this jvm flag in the client, even after most server have patched it.

# If you have been affected
change all of your passwords, and consider wiping your pc if you want to make certian it is gone. I cannot provide a list of things that could be grabbed, as it HAS THE POWER TO RUN ANYTHING THE PERPITRATOR WANTS. Think of this as if ran a ratted client, exept you have NO IDEA what was run on your computer.
